# Architecture

```
DeepUI fluidly asssembles content and actions based on your intentions.
So you can focus on the destination, not the may ways to get there.
```

## Modules
Modules are the building blocks of DeepUI. They are defined using combinations of nouns (items), verbs (actions) and contextual modifiers.

Every Module can be defined and refined using its **Locus** (the action bar). Locus combines the power of a Command-Line Interface with the convenience Natural Language Processing and the discoverability of GUI.

## Flows
In conventional App-driven systems, functions are segregated within different routes / pages. The process of moving from Page to Page without continuity generates friction that takes you out of flow and distracts you from your intentions.

DeepUI is designed to help you enter and stay in flow.

## Spaces
DeepUI generates Spaces based on your intentions. Spaces can scale from a single module to multiple flows. It all depends on the specificty of tour declared intent.

Intitally Spaces will be default provided, having to move towards letting users create a Space from scratch using Blueprints.
