# Getting Started

## Installation

deepui works out of the box with create-react-app (including TypeScript version), Preact cli (with compat), Next.js, Gatsby and any other environment.

To install the deepui run the following within your project directory.

```bash
npm i @deepui/core @deepui/react @tailwindcss/forms

# OR

yarn add @deepui/core @deepui/react @tailwindcss/forms
```

## Configuration

The default theme of this library depends on the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin. To use it, follow the steps on the plugin source page. https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms

DeepEcom UI can be configed in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: "jit",
  purge: [
    // ...
    "./node_modules/@deepui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // path to deepui
  ],
  darkMode: "class", // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require("@tailwindcss/forms"),
    require("@deepui/core"),
  ],
};
```

**Note**: deepui required `jit` mode and `tailwindcss` version `2.1.4` or higher (`basic` mode seems buggy when compiling some components)

## Quick start

Here's a quick example to get you started, **it's literally all you need:**

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { DeepEcomProvider, Button } from "@deepui/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <DeepEcomProvider>
      <Button>Hello DeepEcom</Button>
    </DeepEcomProvider>
  );
}
```
